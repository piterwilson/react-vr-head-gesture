# react-vr-head-gesture
## A demo on how to detect simple head gestures using React VR.

This demo aims to experiment with natural human input gestures -the head nod for _"yes"_ and the head shake for _"no"_ - as a fallback when other forms of input are not available.

Additionally, the almost universal nature of these gestures may be taken advantage of in virtual reality / augmented reality interfaces that try to mimic some degree of natual human body language.
